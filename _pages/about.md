| ![headshot]({{ site.url }}/Tim-iOS-blog/assets/images/headshot1.jpg) | Hi, I'm Tim (you probably guessed that). After 11 years in the Visual Effects / Animation industry, I have been working as an iOS Developer for a little over 3 years, now. In those 3 years, I have worked on several projects and gained valuableknowledge along the way. Recently, I have decided to thoroughly go through the fundamentals of iOS, which was the inspiration for this blog. What better way to learn than by teaching. It is my hope that I will be able to share my knowledge of iOS and help others build a solid foundation of fundamentals in iOS core frameworks and swift. Let the journey begin! |
